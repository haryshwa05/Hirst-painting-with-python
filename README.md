# Hirst-painting-with-python
My first project using python's turtle module 

A Hirst Painting is a style of art created by Damien Hirst, known for his use of colored dots in various arrangements. 
 This is a python project to replicate the style of a Hirst painting, generating an artistic visualization of colored dots.
